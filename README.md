**Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science**

Project 2
--

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code that I had been given pertained to the initial setup of the AI application when it came to the pirate agent and the auto-generation of the game. The code that I had to develop pertained to the actual use-case of this AI and how it learned using Q-learning and whether or not the automation and continued education of the AI had actually grown and flourished within the specified environment it was given. 

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**

- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists study the application of electrical patterns that are encapsulated within computers. This obviously is a specific notation of what a Computer Scientist is, and although that is correct, these electrical patterns can be put into all sorts of different lights, as we could say that this is something like studying code, and how different types of code affect the outcome and performance within different types of computers, or even the entirety of the application of a specific type of software and how it interacts with hardware on a component level when it comes to the solutions of real-time applications such as a nintendo switch, or a playstation. This matters wholey because of the consumer, i.e. those of us that use computers every single day to achieve the accomplishments that otherwise could not be made without a computer. Computers give us an unlimited amount of power if used in a proper manner, and can be a huge benefit to society.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching problems as a computer scientist has to be done from a segmented point of view. Lots of times there are a multitude of challenging problems that occur faster than someone maybe able to solve thme. Being able to pick apart the important variables of a technical issue and apply knowledge to the specific part that maybe an issue is critical, as being able to do this assures that you have an understanding of what is happening, and how exactly each component is critical to each other in the greater spectrum of the problem.

- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization in this instance have to do with the correct implementation of our software, code, and logical problems as if there is a mistake made then the outcome can become critical to individuals as there livelihood is at stake. Personal privacy is something that individuals should be assured when using computers, as this privacy is something that makes sure that we are able to stay safe in a real life setting. The compromisal of this safety can allude to bad actors abusing other people, and ruining their lives through the use of money that is not theres, or even impersonation of another person. The amounts of issues are endless in a world that has to do with computers, and it is incredibly pertinent for us to fight back against the wave of negativity that has arisen with technology.
